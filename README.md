NOT optimised to phone

index & css taken from online
game.js done up myself


main takeaways:

NOT operator in if statements
- execute callback function within event listener ONLY for first listener

ultilising functions within functions for dry code (with diff inputs)
- playAudio() can be ultilised for user click, random button, gameover
